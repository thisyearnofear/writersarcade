# WritArcade Roadmap & Status

**Last Updated:** November 24, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 5 Complete - Launch Ready

## Vision

**Collaborative Content Monetization: Readers as Creative Partners with Newsletter Authors**

WritArcade creates the first platform where newsletter readers collaborate with writers to generate new value from existing content. Starting with Fred Wilson's AVC newsletter on Paragraph.xyz, users spend $AVC tokens to transform articles into unique, playable games—creating sustainable revenue streams for writers, game creators, and the platform through automated 0xSplits and Story Protocol IP management.

**The Collaboration Model:**
- **Writers** (Fred Wilson): 35% of all revenue from games based on their content
- **Game Creators**: 35% ongoing revenue when others play their generated games
- **Token Burn**: 20% of all transactions burned for deflationary economics
- **Platform**: 10% for sustainable development and ecosystem growth

- **WriterCoinPayment**: `0x786AC70DAf4d9779B93EC2DE244cBA66a2b44B80`
- **Revenue Distribution**: 60% writer, 20% platform, 20% creator
- **AVC Whitelist**: Configured and tested

### ✅ Phase 5b: Database & Code Unification (COMPLETE)

#### Database & Schema ✅ DEPLOYED
```bash
# Database: Local PostgreSQL (writarcade)
# Status: ✅ All tables created and verified
psql -U postgres -d writarcade -c "\dt"

# Tables created:
✅ payments (transactionHash, action, amount, status, userId, writerCoinId, timestamps)
✅ games (with nftTokenId, nftTransactionHash, nftMintedAt, paymentId)
✅ users (with payments relationship)
```

**Payment Model (Verified in DB):**
- transactionHash (unique blockchain identifier) ✅
- action ('generate-game' | 'mint-nft') ✅
- amount (BigInt for token units) ✅
- status ('pending' | 'verified' | 'failed') ✅
- Audit trail: createdAt, verifiedAt ✅

**Game Model Updates (Verified in DB):**
- nftTokenId (ERC-721 token ID) ✅
- nftTransactionHash (mint transaction) ✅
- nftMintedAt (timestamp) ✅
- paymentId (link to Payment) ✅

#### Code Consolidation ✅ VERIFIED
- ✅ Mini-app `/api/mini-app/payments/initiate` → uses PaymentCostService
- ✅ Web app `/api/payments/initiate` → uses PaymentCostService
- ✅ Both platforms use `/api/games/generate` unified endpoint
- ✅ No duplicate payment logic (single source of truth)
- ✅ Identical cost calculations: 100 AVC for generation, 50 AVC for minting
- ✅ Verified endpoint response: correct cost + revenue split (60/20/20)

#### Testing Results ✅
**Web App Payment Endpoint:**
- ✅ POST `/api/payments/initiate` returns correct cost
- ✅ Distribution calculated correctly (60% writer, 20% platform, 20% creator)
- ✅ Supports both 'generate-game' and 'mint-nft' actions
- ✅ Shared PaymentCostService used

**Database Integration:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL database created and operational
- ✅ Schema fully applied via `npx prisma db push`
- ✅ Foreign keys configured (Game → Payment, Payment → User)
- ✅ Indexes on transactionHash (unique constraint)
- ✅ Prisma client types regenerated

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ No code duplication in payment logic
- ✅ Both platforms call same service
- ✅ Types unified across endpoints
- ✅ Error handling consistent

#### Known Limitations (Non-Critical for Phase 5b)
- ⏳ Game generation endpoint requires OpenAI/Anthropic API keys (out of scope)
- ⏳ Mini-app full flow has Wagmi/BaseAccount dependency issues (client-side only)
- ℹ️ These don't affect Phase 5b core requirements (payment tracking + schema)
