## Multichain Strategy: Story Protocol + Base

### Current Architecture (Base Only)
```
WritArcade Today:
  Article → Game Generation → Mint on Base NFT
            (Paragraph)        (ERC-721)
                ↓
            $AVC Payment (creator coins)
```

### Enhanced Architecture (Story + Base)
```
WritArcade + Story Protocol:
  Article → Game Generation → Register on Story IP → Mint on Base NFT
   (Paragraph)  (WritArcade AI)    (IP Asset)      (ERC-721)
                                        ↓
                            Royalty Token (Story)
                                        ↓
                            Yield Farming on Base
                          (Aave/Compound on Story)
```

### How Multichain Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

**Story Protocol** = IP blockchain
- Registers games as intellectual property
- Tracks ownership, permissions, royalties
- Issues "Royalty Tokens" (ERC-1155) for fractional ownership
- Built for IP rights, not for payments

**Base** = Payments + execution blockchain
- Where $AVC creator coins live
- Where users pay for game generation
- Where NFT games are minted (ERC-721)
- Where yield farming happens (Aave, Compound)

**Bridge Between Them**:
```
Step 1: User pays on Base
   Article URL + $100 AVC on Base

Step 2: WritArcade generates game
   AI game created locally

Step 3: Register on Story Protocol
   Game metadata + author permissions → Story IP
   Story returns IP Asset ID

Step 4: Mint on Base
   Link Story IP ID → Base NFT mint
   Royalty tokens minted on Story

Step 5: Earn Yield (Optional)
   Creator holds royalty tokens
   Stake on Aave/Compound (native on Story now)
   Earn interest in STORY token
```

### Data Flow Example

```
User: "Make a game from Fred Wilson's article"

1. WritArcade (Base): User sends 100 $AVC → WriterCoinPayment.sol

2. WritArcade Backend: Generate game from article

3. Story Protocol: Register game as IP
   {
     name: "Horror Game #123 from Article X",
     author: "fredwilson (Paragraph)",
     creator: "user.eth",
     royalties: [
       { recipient: "fredwilson", share: 60% },
       { recipient: "user.eth", share: 30% },
       { recipient: "writarcade.eth", share: 10% }
     ]
   }
   → Returns IP Asset ID on Story

4. Base NFT: Mint game NFT linked to Story IP
   GameNFT.mint(user.eth, {
     storyIPId: "0x123...",
     baseURI: "ipfs://...",
     game: {...}
   })

5. Story: Issue Royalty Tokens
   Royalty tokens auto-issued to addresses in split
   Each token = share of future game revenues

6. Yield (Optional):
   Creators can stake royalty tokens
   Earn APY on Story ecosystem (initially ~5-10%)
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Why both Story + Base?**
1. **Best of both worlds**: Story for IP, Base for payments + execution
2. **User experience**: Doesn't require Story wallet, uses Base (already have MetaMask, Coinbase)
3. **Ecosystem alignment**: Story is launching IP economy, Base has creator coins ecosystem
4. **Royalty automation**: Story handles complex IP splits natively

**Bridging Complexity**:
- ✅ **Simple for users**: They see one game → one NFT → one royalty token
- ⚠️ **Complex for devs**: Must sync state across 2 chains
- 🔧 **Solution**: Backend handles sync; user-facing UI is simple

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- Story Protocol mainnet must be live (✅ Already is)
- Story SDK support for Royalty Tokens (✅ Available)
- Cross-chain bridge for syncing (❌ Need to build or use deBridge)
- Author permission system (🔧 Custom contract on Story)
