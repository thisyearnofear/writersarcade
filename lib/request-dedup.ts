/**
 * Request Deduplication Utility
 *
 * Prevents duplicate concurrent calls for the same key by returning the
 * same in-flight promise. Callers with the same key share one execution.
 *
 * The deduplication cache is keyed by a string and holds at most `maxSize`
 * entries (LRU-evicted). Promises are kept until they settle, after which
 * the entry is removed so a future call with the same key starts a fresh
 * request.
 *
 * **Limitation**: the cache is in-memory and process-local. On serverless
 * platforms (e.g. Vercel) multiple function instances may run concurrently,
 * so this does not deduplicate across instances. Use a shared cache (Redis,
 * Postgres advisory locks, etc.) if cross-instance deduplication is required.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const data = await deduplicate('games:featured', () =>
 *   prisma.game.findMany({ where: { featured: true } })
 * )
 * ```
