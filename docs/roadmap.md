# WritArcade Roadmap & Status

**Last Updated:** December 11, 2025
**Status:** Phase 6 Complete - Asset Marketplace Live

## Vision

**Collaborative Content Monetization: Readers as Creative Partners with Newsletter Authors**

WritArcade creates the first platform where newsletter readers collaborate with writers to generate new value from existing content. Starting with Fred Wilson's AVC newsletter on Paragraph.xyz, users spend $AVC tokens to transform articles into unique, playable games—creating sustainable revenue streams for writers, game creators, and the platform through automated 0xSplits and Story Protocol IP management.

**The Collaboration Model:**
- **Writers** (Fred Wilson): 35% of all revenue from games based on their content
- **Game Creators**: 35% ongoing revenue when others play their generated games
- **Token Burn**: 20% of all transactions burned for deflationary economics
- **Platform**: 10% for sustainable development and ecosystem growth
