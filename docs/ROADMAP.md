# WritArcade Roadmap & Status

## Vision

**Give AVC readers a new way to engage: turn Fred Wilson's articles into playable, mintable games.**

AVC readers can spend their writer coins to generate unique game interpretations of Fred's articles, creating a new economy around content—all natively within Farcaster. MVP launches with AVC only; other writer coins added later.

## Core Concept

### The Flow
1. **User in Farcaster Mini App**: Opens WritArcade app
2. **Paste AVC Article URL**: User provides Paragraph article link from AVC (https://avc.xyz/)
3. **Fetch Article**: Backend scrapes title + content from Paragraph
4. **Customize Game**: Select genre (Horror/Comedy/Mystery) + difficulty (Easy/Hard)
5. **Pay in $AVC**: User approves 100 $AVC token spending in Farcaster Wallet
6. **AI Generates**: Unique game interpretation created in seconds
7. **Play Immediately**: Interactive game plays in-app
8. **Mint as NFT**: User can mint generated game as Base NFT for 50 $AVC (optional)
9. **Share on Farcaster**: Link to game shareable via Farcaster cast

### Key Insight
**Same article → Infinite unique game versions**
- Horror interpretation vs. Comedy interpretation
- Easy mode vs. Hard mode
- Different narrative angles

Each version is a unique creative expression, making games collectible and incentivizing sharing.

## Go-to-Market Strategy (MVP)

### Launch: Farcaster Community (Week 5)

**Target**: Early adopters in Farcaster
- Paragraph writers on Farcaster
- Base ecosystem builders
- Game/frame developers
- Crypto-native audiences

**Approach**:
1. Post in Farcaster Mini Apps developer group
2. Create demo game from public article
3. Share link in casts/channels
4. Gather feedback + iterate

**Goal**: 50-100 MVP users, prove mechanics work

## Future Vision (Phase 2+)

### Phase 2: Expansion
- More tokens (HIGHER, others)
- More customization (art style, tone, length)
- Leaderboards + creator recognition
- Share to cast (game links go viral)
- Creator analytics

### Phase 3: Ecosystem
- Newsletter/blog partnerships
- Game marketplace/discovery
- Cross-chain support (Optimism, Arbitrum)
- Creator incubator program
- Advanced AI models

### Phase 4: Protocol
- Open gaming protocol
- Third-party builders
- DAO governance
- Token for creators
- Global creator economy

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Farcaster-Native**: Built inside Farcaster Mini Apps, launches with Paragraph integration
2. **First Real Use Case**: Gives Paragraph writer coins immediate, tangible utility
3. **Infinite Variety**: Same article → infinite game interpretations
4. **Fast to Play**: Generate + play game in <2 minutes
5. **Collectible**: Games are minted as Base NFTs, shareable
6. **Creator-Centric**: Writers control their own token distribution
7. **Community Engagement**: Readers spend writer coins on favorite content

## Revenue Model (MVP)

### MVP Revenue Streams

1. **Platform Cut** (20% of game generation)
   - 100 games/week × 100 $AVC × 20% = 2,000 $AVC/week
   - At $0.01/$AVC = $20/week
   - **Not a priority at MVP stage**

2. **Focus**: Prove product-market fit first
   - Gather user feedback
   - Iterate on mechanics
   - Build retention

3. **Future Revenue** (Phase 2+)
   - Premium customization options
   - Creator leaderboard badges/rewards
   - Advanced analytics for creators
   - API access for third parties

## Example User Journey (MVP)

### Typical User Flow
1. Opens WritArcade in Farcaster Mini App
2. Pastes Paragraph article URL (e.g., `paragraph.com/@writer/article`)
3. Selects game genre (Horror/Comedy/Mystery)
4. Selects difficulty (Easy/Hard)
5. Clicks "Generate Game for 100 $AVC"
6. Approves spending in Farcaster Wallet
7. Watches game generate (AI streaming response)
8. Plays game immediately in-app
9. (Optional) Clicks "Mint as NFT for 50 $AVC"
10. Shares game link on Farcaster

**Result**: User created + minted a game in <5 minutes, shareable on Farcaster, costs ~$1-2 USD
