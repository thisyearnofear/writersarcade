# WritArcade

Transform articles into playable, mintable games where readers can spend writer coins to generate unique game interpretations—all natively within Farcaster.

## Vision

**Collaborative Content Creation with Newsletter Authors on Paragraph.xyz**

WritArcade enables readers to collaborate with their favorite newsletter authors by transforming articles into unique, playable games. Starting with Fred Wilson's AVC newsletter, users spend $AVC tokens to generate novel game experiences based on Fred's content, creating a new revenue stream that benefits everyone:

- **Writers** (Fred Wilson): Earn 35% of all transaction revenue from games based on their content
- **Game Creators**: Earn 35% revenue share when others play their generated games  
- **Token Burn**: 20% of all transactions burned for deflationary tokenomics
- **Platform**: Sustains development with 10% platform fee

This creates a sustainable ecosystem where high-quality content drives new forms of engagement, writers monetize their archives, and readers become creative collaborators rather than passive consumers.

## Core Flow

```
User in Farcaster → Select $AVC → Paste Fred's Article URL → Customize Game Style → Pay 100 $AVC → AI Generates Game → Play → Mint as NFT (50 $AVC)
```

**Revenue Distribution (via 0xSplits):**
- 35% → Fred Wilson's treasury (writer collaboration)
- 35% → Game creator (for future plays of their specific game)  
- 20% → Token burn (deflationary mechanism)
- 10% → Platform development & operations
