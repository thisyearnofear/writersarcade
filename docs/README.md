# WritArcade Documentation

## Overview

The documentation has been consolidated from multiple files into four main documents to reduce bloat and improve organization. The STORY files have been preserved as requested.

## Consolidated Documents

1. **consolidated_architecture.md** - System architecture, database schema, smart contracts, and technical design
2. **consolidated_development.md** - Development setup, configuration, testing procedures, and implementation status
3. **consolidated_hackathon.md** - Story Protocol buildathon strategy and implementation plan
4. **consolidated_roadmap.md** - Product roadmap, implementation phases, and future vision

## Preserved Files (STORY-related)

- **STORY_PROTOCOL_SETUP.md** - Story Protocol integration setup
- **STORY_PROTOCOL_STATUS.md** - Story Protocol integration status
- **STORY_SDK_REFERENCE.md** - Story Protocol SDK reference documentation

- HACKATHON.md → consolidated into consolidated_hackathon.md
- ROADMAP.md → consolidated into consolidated_roadmap.md
