### Mezo Hackathon Integration (MUSD) — April–May 2026
- ✅ Mezo Matsnet (testnet) chain config (chainId 31611, RPC `https://rpc.test.mezo.org`)
- ✅ Multi-chain simulation via Tenderly
- ✅ MUSD payment architecture (Strategy Pattern) decoupled from Base
- ✅ `MezoPaymentSplitter` deployed to Mezo Testnet at [`0x32D0356f533cC429F94Db73f383bBb21a459E16b`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0x32D0356f533cC429F94Db73f383bBb21a459E16b)
- ✅ `MUSDStrategy` wired to call `approve` → `payForGeneration` / `payAndMintGame` on the splitter (atomic on-chain platform/creator/writer split)
- ✅ UI updated for Mezo Passport & MUSD toggles
- ✅ MEZO touchpoint (Phase 1): on-chain `useMezoBalance` reads from MEZO ERC-20 (`0x7B7c…0001`), "MEZO Holder" badge surfaces in the MUSD payment flow when balance ≥ `MEZO_CONFIG.holderThreshold`
- ✅ **`MezoBoostedSplitter` deployed** at [`0x56Ee5A3f122da00B635DdbB319708e24450aEB89`](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/address/0x56Ee5A3f122da00B635DdbB319708e24450aEB89) — 10% creator share boost for MEZO holders, enforced on-chain
- ✅ **Real MUSD balance reading** — `useMUSDBalance` hook replaces mocked "Available" with on-chain balance
- ✅ **One-click payment flow** — removed intermediate "review payment" gate; PaymentOption always visible; pay and generate in one action
- ✅ **Simplified form UX** — Wordle mode hidden for clean narrative focus; submit button always visible; success state resets deferred to modal close
- ✅ **Critial env bug fix** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEZO_PAYMENT_SPLITTER_TESTNET` was pointing to MUSD token address instead of the splitter contract
- ✅ **Hackathon submission** — architecture, contract addresses, flow diagrams (doc removed after the hackathon)
- ✅ **TypeScript fixed** — removed deprecated `ignoreDeprecations`, installed deps, fixed null-check — `tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly
- ✅ **Wordle revived** — free tier toggle restored alongside Story, Farcaster sharing on win screen, Daily Wordle section on homepage
- ✅ **Mezo Analytics dashboard** — `/mezo/analytics` page with live on-chain reads from MezoBoostedSplitter (viem → API route → stat cards, boosted ratio, recent activity feed); Goldsky pipeline config updated for v2 contract address

### Phase 13: Wordle Revival + Farcaster — May 2026
- ✅ Wordle toggle restored as free tier alongside Story (premium)
- ✅ Farcaster sharing on Wordle win screen (share results as casts)
- ✅ Daily Wordle section on homepage
- ✅ CDR Hackathon integration (May 27–June 5): store Wordle answers and secret panels in CDR vaults; lazy-load SDK/WASM; gate secret panels by completed gameplay + minted Game NFT ownership

### Phase 18-21: Identity, Resonance & Embeds (July 2026)

A four-phase push to remove wallet friction at the top of the funnel and give creators analytics on how their stories perform.

#### Phase 18 — Progressive Identity ✅
- Nullable `walletAddress`; new `email` and `guestKey` columns on `User`
- HMAC-signed cookies for wallet, email, and guest sessions
- `getActor()` precedence: wallet → email → guest
- Automatic merge of games, credits, and payments on identity upgrade

#### Phase 19 — Server-Verified Credits & Magic Link ✅
- Credit balance derived from signed session, not request body
- `credits:<hash>` sentinel `Payment` rows unify credit and on-chain funding lookups
- Magic-link email auth via Resend; required at fiat credit purchase time (409 → email link → merge)
- Guest/email users can buy credits and generate games without a wallet

#### Phase 20 — `/studio` Free Demo ✅
- `/studio` page: paste marketing copy, pick tone, generate a playable story
- First story is free; subsequent stories prompt for credits
- No crypto required to create or play

#### Phase 21 — Resonance, Embeds & Insights ✅
- `GamePlayEvent` extended with `type`, `sessionId`, `panelIndex`, `choiceIndex`, `choiceText`, `referrer`, `embedded`
- `/embed/[slug]` wallet-free iframe player with `?ref=` attribution and "Made with WritersArcade" backlink
- `/games/[slug]/insights` owner dashboard: resonance score, panel funnel, choice splits, referrers, embed snippet

---

### Phase 1-4: 8.5/10 Product Polish (June 2026)

Complete rewrite of the product foundation across 4 phases:

#### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
- ✅ Payment flow tests (37 tests: cost service, strategies, initiate route)
- ✅ Pruned dead code — down to 30 intentional warnings
- ✅ Sentry error monitoring (client/server/edge config files + @sentry/nextjs)
- ✅ CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — type-check, lint, test, build on push)
- ✅ Cache consolidation — removed duplicate `__splitCache` in `lib/contracts.ts`, shared `lib/cache.ts`
- ✅ Feature flags (`config.features` in `lib/config.ts`) — non-core features default OFF

#### Phase 2 — Architecture ✅
- ✅ `lib/` → `services/` split — moved analytics, error-handler, rate-limit, auth to `services/` with backward-compatible re-exports
- ✅ `PaymentStrategyFactory` — singleton DI for payment strategies, replaces direct `new WriterCoinStrategy()` / `new MUSDStrategy()`
- ✅ `lib/api-response.ts` — standardized `ok()`, `fail()`, `notFound()`, `unauthorized()`, `forbidden()`, `serverError()`, `paginated()` helpers

#### Phase 3 — UX & Product ✅
- ✅ Progressive disclosure entry flow — wallet/chain/payment removed from first view. URL → game in 2 clicks
- ✅ Simplified `SimpleGameForm` — removed PaymentPath, wagmi hooks, payment toggle, chain warnings
- ✅ Contextual micro-copy — "Why pay?" explanation in generator form
- ✅ Writer ticker on homepage — just names + symbols, no chain/coin mentions

#### Phase 4 — Polish ✅
- ✅ `loading.tsx` + `error.tsx` at 5 route segments (`games/`, `my-games/`, `profile/`, `generate/`, `writers/[coinId]/`)
- ✅ `lib/request-dedup.ts` — `deduplicate<T>()` with LRU eviction (max 500)
- ✅ `lib/ai-cache.ts` — AI generation cache keys + deduplication wrapper, wired into `POST /api/games/generate`
- ✅ `lib/latency-monitor.ts` — `monitorLatency()` wrapper with 10K ring buffer, p50/p95/p99 reporting
- ✅ Bundle optimization — `GameGeneratorForm` dynamically imported on `/generate` page (`next/dynamic`, `ssr: false`)
- ✅ Global ToastProvider + Toaster already wired in `ClientProviders.tsx`

### CDR Hackathon Strategy (May 27 – June 5, 2026)

**Event:** [CDR (Confidential Data Rails) Hackathon](https://build.usecdr.dev/) by Story Protocol. $3k prizes.

**WritersArcade Strategy: From Gated Content to Confidential IP**

We are transitioning our "Secret Panel" logic from Lit Protocol (ERC-721 gating) to **Story Confidential Data Rails (CDR)**. This moves us from simple "access control" to true "Confidential IP" where the source data is protected by TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments).

**Integration Points:**

1. **TEE-Backed Secret Panels (Vaults):**
   - **Implemented:** AI-generated hidden epilogues are stored in CDR vaults as `promptVaultUuid`.
   - **Condition:** CDR `tokenGate` read condition points at the Game NFT contract selected from `writerCoinId`.
   - **Runtime Gate:** Unlock requires a completed 5-panel story session and exact `nftTokenId` ownership.
   - **Value:** Turns the story ending into confidential, ownable game IP instead of ordinary app-gated content.

2. **Provably Fair Wordle Answers:**
   - **Implemented:** Article-derived Wordle answers are stored in a CDR vault instead of plaintext DB fields.
   - **Current Scope:** Secondary proof point; final demo should emphasize secret panels as the richer CDR flow.
   - **Future Upgrade:** Add reveal-after-game or give-up conditions for stronger technical judging.

3. **Confidential Asset Marketplace:**
   - Asset creators can upload "Confidential Assets" (high-res textures, original character sketches) that are only revealed to buyers.
   - CDR handles the dynamic access control based on Story Protocol licensing terms.

**Why we are a Top Candidate:**
- **Adjacency:** Already live on Story Aeneid; low friction to adopt CDR SDK.
- **Product-Market Fit:** Enables a "Trade Secret" marketplace where prompt engineering is monetizable without being clonable.
- **Technical Polish:** Existing Lit Protocol logic provides a perfect "before" case for a "before/after" CDR implementation demo.

**Timeline:**
- **May 27-29:** Research CDR SDK, integrate SDK, resolve WASM/webpack build issues.
- **May 30:** Implement CDR vaulted Wordle answers and CDR vaulted secret panels.
- **May 30:** Add completed-playthrough + exact NFT ownership unlock policy and visible access-policy UI.
- **June 1-4:** Runtime demo QA, fresh-game demo recording, final submission polish.

## Current Initiative: Creation UX (August 2026)

The first-run creation flow follows the [Creation UX Contract](./CREATION_UX.md): **Source → Story direction → Generate**. Creation is compact and mobile-first; advanced payment/model controls stay progressively disclosed; animation and ending expansion happen after a playable story exists.

### Delivered: Compact Creation & Progressive Optionality
- [x] Collapse the first-run creation surface to source, tone, story intensity, and one primary generate action
- [x] Make mobile continuation persistent and keep primary CTAs within reach
- [x] Use outcome-based visual presets instead of technical model names
- [x] Show a non-spoiler five-beat story shape before generation
- [x] Keep animation, alternate endings, and deep model controls in post-generation/refinement paths
- [x] Instrument and persist the mobile funnel, generation completion, play start, and post-completion expansion
- [x] Validate the flow at 390×844: no horizontal overflow; source input and preview action meet the 48px touch-target rule


### Delivered: Measurement
- [x] Add the bounded admin-only funnel report over persisted `ProductAnalyticsEvent` records (`GET /api/admin/analytics/funnel?days=30`, 1–90 day window)
- [x] Document the report as event-volume ratios rather than unique-user/session conversion

### Next: Post-Generation Expansion
- [ ] Add a retention/cleanup policy for `ProductAnalyticsEvent` before production volume grows materially
- [ ] Make the completion tray the home for share, ownership, reader insights, and animation
- [ ] Test demand for alternate endings before building a full ending editor
- [ ] Promote Workshop/Creator Studio as refinement, not a prerequisite for first play

## Phase 22: Generation UX & Payment Reliability (September 2026)

### Delivered: Generation Timeout & Cancellation
- [x] `GameGenerationOverlay` shows a slow warning at 45s and a stall warning at 90s with an explicit Cancel action
- [x] Generation fetch is wired to an `AbortController`; user cancellation stops the active HTTP request
- [x] `fetchWithTimeout` distinguishes timeout aborts (retryable) from user cancel aborts
- [x] `services/error-handler.ts` classifies `AbortError` so deliberate cancellation does not surface as a generic failure

### Delivered: Money-Moving API Response Standardization
- [x] `POST /api/credits/spend` returns `ok()` / `fail()` from `lib/api-response.ts` with stable codes (`SPEND_CONFLICT`, etc.)
- [x] `POST /api/payments/verify` returns structured errors for unauthorized, wallet mismatch, hash conflicts, missing payments, and validation failures
- [x] Credit spend uses an atomic Prisma update to prevent concurrent double-spend on the same balance

### Delivered: Cross-Instance Duplicate Generation Guard
- [x] Added `GenerationLock` Prisma model with `key (unique)`, `status`, `resultData`, and `expiresAt`
- [x] Added `lib/generation-lock.ts` `withSharedGenerationLock()` for Postgres-backed shared locking across Vercel instances
- [x] Updated `lib/ai-cache.ts` so `buildGenerationCacheKey()` includes `actorId` / `paymentId` and `deduplicateGeneration()` uses the shared lock
- [x] Added `@@unique([paymentId])` to `Game` and updated `GameDatabaseService.createGame()` to return the existing game on a payment-id unique violation
- [x] Added `tests/generation-lock.test.ts` covering owner, waiter, stale-lock takeover, and failure paths

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI generation failures | Retry logic, multiple model fallbacks |
| Duplicate paid generations | `GenerationLock` (Postgres) + `@@unique([paymentId])` on `Game` |
| Story Protocol testnet issues | Mock mode for demos, graceful degradation |
| Image generation slow | Parallel generation, optimistic UI |
| Network dependency | Multi-provider fallback chain |
| User confusion | Progress indicators, tooltips, empty states |
| Inconsistent API errors | `lib/api-response.ts` standard; money-moving routes migrated |

## Collaboration Model

**On-chain revenue distribution** (configurable per writer coin):
- **Generation**: 60% Writer / 20% Platform / 20% Creator Pool
- **Minting**: 50% Creator / 15% Writer / 5% Platform (30% refunded to minter)

This ensures:
- Writers earn from readers using their content creatively
- Creators are rewarded for personalization work
- Platform sustainability for ongoing development
