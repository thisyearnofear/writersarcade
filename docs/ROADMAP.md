# WritArcade Roadmap & Status

**Last Updated:** November 24, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 5 Complete - Launch Ready

## Vision

**Give AVC readers a new way to engage: turn Fred Wilson's articles into playable, mintable games.**

AVC readers can spend their writer coins to generate unique game interpretations of Fred's articles, creating a new economy around content—all natively within Farcaster. MVP launches with AVC only; other writer coins added later.

### ✅ Phase 5b: Database & Testing Setup (Execution Ready)

#### Schema & Migrations ✅
```bash
# Migration SQL ready in: prisma/migrations/add_payment_and_nft_tracking/
npx prisma migrate deploy  # Apply
npx prisma generate       # Update client types
```

**Payment Model:**
- transactionHash (unique blockchain identifier)
- action ('generate-game' | 'mint-nft')
- amount (BigInt for token units)
- status ('pending' | 'verified' | 'failed')
- Audit trail: createdAt, verifiedAt

**Game Model Updates:**
- nftTokenId (ERC-721 token ID)
- nftTransactionHash (mint transaction)
- nftMintedAt (timestamp)
- paymentId (link to Payment)

#### Code Consolidation ✅
- ✅ Mini-app `/api/payments/initiate` → uses PaymentCostService
- ✅ Web app `/api/payments/initiate` → uses PaymentCostService
- ✅ Both platforms use `/api/games/generate` unified endpoint
- ✅ No duplicate payment logic
- ✅ Identical cost calculations across environments

#### Testing Checklist
**Web App:**
- [ ] Free flow: Generate without wallet
- [ ] Paid flow: MetaMask → customize → pay → generate
- [ ] Cost matches mini-app exactly

**Mini-App:**
- [ ] Coin selection → URL → customize → pay → play → mint
- [ ] Payment creation recorded to database
- [ ] NFT mint tracked (nftTokenId, hash, timestamp)

**Cross-Platform:**
- [ ] Same cost for same action
- [ ] Same database structure
- [ ] Same endpoint logic

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Database migrations apply
- ✅ Payment model created
- ✅ Game NFT fields added
- ✅ Both endpoints unified
- ⏳ Test execution + go/no-go decision
