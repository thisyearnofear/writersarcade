# WritArcade

Transform articles into playable, mintable games where readers can spend writer coins to generate unique game interpretations—all natively within Farcaster.

## Vision

Give AVC readers a new way to engage: turn Fred Wilson's articles into playable, mintable games using $AVC tokens. Users select genre (Horror/Comedy/Mystery) + difficulty (Easy/Hard), pay 100 $AVC, generate unique game interpretations, and optionally mint as Base NFTs for 50 $AVC.

## Core Flow

```
User in Farcaster → Select Writer Coin → Paste Article URL → Customize Game → Pay & Generate → Play → Mint as NFT
```

## Quick Start
