## 🎯 Current Focus: Customization MVP

### Vision Statement
> "Turn any article into a personalized visual comic story you own as IP."

### The User Story
> "I read Fred's article about AI, turned it into a horror comic about my startup, tweaked the villain to look like my ex-VC, and minted it as IP on Story Protocol."

### Hackathon Alignment
**Track**: Creative Front-End ($5,000 prize)
> "Create intuitive, aesthetic, and user-friendly front-ends for popular IP x AI use cases—seamlessly integrated with the Story SDK and IP registration flows."

## Technical Architecture

### Current Flow
```
Article URL → AI Generate Game → Play (5 panels) → Finale → Mint
```

### New Flow (MVP)
```
Article URL 
    → AI Extract Assets (preview) 
    → [EDIT: Assets] 
    → AI Compile Comic 
    → Play (5 panels with regeneration) 
    → [EDIT: Narrative text]
    → Finale 
    → Register IP on Story Protocol
    → Mint NFT on Base
```

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `GameAIService.generateAssets()` | Extract assets from article | ✅ Live |
| `GameAIService.generateGame()` | Compile assets into game | ✅ Live |
| `ImageGenerationService` | Generate panel images | ✅ Live |
| `StoryProtocolAssetService` | Register IP | ✅ Live |
| `ComicPanelCard` | Render panels + regenerate | ✅ Enhanced |
| `ComicBookFinale` | Final comic + text editing | ✅ Enhanced |
| `AssetCard` | Asset display + inline edit | ✅ Enhanced |
| `GamePlayInterface` | Wire regeneration + editing | ✅ Enhanced |
| Asset Preview UI (Workshop) | Show/edit assets before compilation | ✅ Live |

## Success Criteria

### Hackathon Demo
- [x] User pastes article URL
- [x] Assets extracted and shown for editing (Workshop: /workshop)
- [x] User modifies a character name (inline editing)
- [x] Comic generated with customization
- [x] User regenerates one panel image ("New Image" button)
- [x] User edits narrative text (pencil icon in finale)
- [x] User mints as IP on Story Protocol
- [x] Transaction confirmed, IP registered

### Metrics
- Complete flow in < 5 minutes
- Zero crashes during demo
- Story Protocol IP ID visible in UI
- All customizations preserved in minted metadata

---

## Collaboration Model (Unchanged)

**On-chain revenue distribution (configurable per writer coin):**
- **Generation**: 60% Writer, 20% Platform, 20% Creator Pool
- **Minting**: 30% Creator, 15% Writer, 5% Platform

This ensures:
- Writers earn from readers using their content creatively
- Creators are rewarded for personalization work
- Platform sustainability for ongoing development
