# Platform Features

## Core Flows

### Creation UX Contract

The first-run creation path is **Source → Story direction → Generate**. It is compact and mobile-first by design:

- Primary controls: source preview, tone, story intensity, and one clear generation action.
- Advanced controls: payment rails, writer selection, technical model/provider details, IP, and marketplace enrichment remain progressively disclosed.
- The pre-generation preview shows a five-beat story shape, not the exact ending.
- Animation and alternate-ending expansion are post-generation actions after a playable story exists.
- The Workshop/Creator Studio is refinement for deeper control, not a prerequisite for first play.

See the [Creation UX Contract](./CREATION_UX.md) for the decision record, feedback triage rules, mobile interaction rules, validation checkpoint, and success metrics.

### Article → Game (Classic)
1. **Input**: Paste article URL → AI extracts assets
2. **Optional**: After preview, **Today's world** card — stage the article in today's BasePaint canvas (suggested when Daily is live) or keep article-only
3. **Customize** (Optional): Edit characters & mechanics in Workshop
4. **Generate**: Compile assets into 5-panel comic story (`contentType: 'dual'` when staged)
5. **Refine**: Regenerate images with custom prompts + edit text
6. **Register**: Mint NFT & register IP on Story Protocol (user-owned)
7. **Revenue**: Splits executed on-chain (Writer/Platform/Creator)

### Marketing Copy → Playable Story (`/studio`)
1. **Input**: Paste landing page copy, email, or campaign text
2. **Choose tone**: Mystery, Comedy, or Horror
3. **Generate**: AI turns the copy into an interactive 5-panel story
4. **Play / embed**: Try it, share the embed code, or buy credits for more
5. **Analyze**: Use Resonance insights to see which framings readers choose

This flow is wallet-free for the first story and targets marketers, copywriters, and brand teams who want to test messaging through play.

## Key Features

### AI Game Generation
- Article URL or pasted marketing copy → AI extracts characters, story beats, mechanics
- Generates 5-panel comic with narrative
- Genre selection (horror, sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, comedy, etc.)
- Multi-model AI pipeline (OpenAI, Anthropic via ai-sdk)

### Progressive Identity (No Wallet Required)
- Start instantly as an anonymous guest
- Attach an email at any time via magic link to preserve progress across devices
- Connect a wallet later to mint NFTs, register IP, or receive on-chain revenue
- Automatic merge: games, credits, and payments follow the user across identity upgrades

### `/studio` — Copy-to-Story
- Paste up to 20,000 characters of marketing copy
- Pick a tone (mystery, comedy, horror)
- First story is free (one demo per actor/IP); subsequent stories cost credits
- One-click upgrade to credit packs when the free demo is used

### Daily Challenge (Inco Confidential Game Sessions)

**Product role**: Shared daily ritual inside writersarcade — same dual source for everyone, unique run per player.  
**Dual source (default when configured)**: Featured article (plot / writer voice) + today's [BasePaint](https://basepaint.xyz) canvas (world / palette / visuals).  
**Fallback source**: BasePaint-only when no featured article URL is set.  
**Mechanic**: Inco encrypted modifier hand — independent of source composition.  
**Integration**: `DailyChallengeVault.sol` + `@inco/lightning-js` + `lib/basepaint/` (REST + GraphQL).  
**Docs**: [`docs/BASEPAINT.md`](./BASEPAINT.md)

Each day, everyone shares the same article × canvas mashup. Every playthrough deals 5 encrypted modifier cards from a 52-card deck — same story material, different constraints, provably fair.

- **Dual source**: Article supplies plot, voice, and themes; BasePaint supplies theme word, palette, canvas image, and vision description. Prompt assembly merges both.
- **Encrypted Modifier Deck**: 52 narrative constraint cards shuffled once per day on-chain via `e.shuffledRange()`. The order is encrypted — nobody can predict it.
- **5 Encrypted Cards Per Player**: Each player draws the next 5 cards from the shared deck via `startSession()` (no duplicates within a session). Only the player can decrypt at reveal.
- **Hidden AI Constraints**: The backend decrypts each panel's card (via `narrativeOperator`) to shape AI generation. The player never sees the modifier until the finale.
- **Encrypted Scoring**: Player choices are compared against the hidden modifier's optimal path via `e.select()` and `e.eq()`. Score stays encrypted until reveal.
- **Reveal at Finale**: `completeAndReveal()` publishes handles; the client decrypts via `attestedDecrypt` and submits to the leaderboard.
- **Attribution**: Writer / article credit + BasePaint contributors + mint CTA.

**Flow**:
```
Cron or POST /api/daily-challenge/setup
  ↓
DailyChallengeVault.createDailyChallenge(day) → e.shuffledRange(1..52)
  ↓
Resolve dual source: featured article + BasePaint day (or BasePaint-only fallback)
  ↓
Player calls startSession(day) → 5 encrypted cards dealt (narrativeOperator + player get allow)
  ↓
Each panel: server decrypts card for AI only → generatePanelWithModifier()
  ↓
Player choice → POST /record-choice → encrypted score delta on-chain
  ↓
Finale: completeAndReveal() → attestedDecrypt → leaderboard + dual attribution
```

**Smart Contract**: [`DailyChallengeVault`](https://basescan.org/address/0xcc271a53e4286012f3289273fdaa32f66fa64a33) (v3 — per-panel FHE verdicts, gradient scoring) on Base mainnet  
**Cron** (Inco shuffle + Paragraph featured pick — idempotent):
1. **VPS systemd timer (primary)** — `scripts/cron/install-daily-challenge-cron.sh` → `00:05 UTC` curls `POST /api/daily-challenge/setup`
2. **GitHub Actions (backup)** — `.github/workflows/daily-challenge-shuffle.yml` at 00:15 UTC (repo secret `CRON_SECRET`)
3. **Lazy fallback** — `GET /api/daily-challenge/start` runs setup if today's deck/featured row is missing when Daily loads
**SDK**: `@inco/lightning-js` — `attestedDecrypt` for modifier/score reveal  
**Modifier Deck**: `lib/daily-challenge/modifiers.json` — 52 cards across 4 categories  
**Config**: Featured article auto-picked daily from Paragraph allowlist (writer coins / `DAILY_CHALLENGE_FEATURED_PUBLICATIONS`); manual override via `POST /api/daily-challenge/featured`; env URL is fallback only  


**Pages**: `/basepaint` (canonical Daily Challenge UI); `/daily` redirects there; `/basepaint/day/[n]` archive; `/basepaint/collection`

### Embeddable Wallet-Free Player
- `/embed/[slug]` serves an lightweight iframe player
- No wallet connection required; readers play inside the host page
- `?ref=YOUR_CAMPAIGN` attribution tracked in Resonance analytics
- "Made with WritersArcade" backlink drives organic acquisition
- ISR-cached for fast loads

### Resonance Dashboard
Owner-gated analytics at `/games/[slug]/insights`:
- **Resonance score**: completions / starts (shown once ≥ 5 starts)
- **Panel funnel**: drop-off at each panel and choice
- **Choice splits**: percentage of readers choosing each option
- **Referrers**: which campaigns / placements drive starts
- **Embed snippet**: copy-paste HTML with `?ref=` tracking

### Asset Workshop
- **Decomposition Engine**: Breaks articles into reusable assets
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: Edit characters, mechanics, visuals
- **Marketplace Sidebar**: Inject community assets into games
- **Database Persistence**: Save drafts, iterate over time
- Assets typed as: `pack`, `character`, `mechanic`, `plot`

### Image Generation (Multi-Provider)
Auto-fallback chain ensures reliability:

1. **Venice AI** (Primary) - `venice-sd35`, 1024x1024
2. **Modal** (Fallback 1) - Self-hosted SD 1.5, 512x512, pay-per-use GPU
3. **Netmind AI** (Fallback 2) - OpenAI-compatible API

See [scripts/modal/README.md](../scripts/modal/README.md) for Modal deployment.

### Mezo MUSD Payments — archived hackathon track
History lives in [`docs/HACKATHONS_ARCHIVE.md`](./HACKATHONS_ARCHIVE.md#3-mezo-hackathon-musd-track-aprmay-2026--archived). Code remains for reference (`MUSDStrategy`, `MezoPaymentSplitter`/`MezoBoostedSplitter`, `useMezoBalance`, "MEZO Holder" badge).

- **MUSD Strategy**: Native payment support on Mezo Matsnet (Chain ID 31611).
- **On-chain Splitter**: Uses `MezoPaymentSplitter` to atomically distribute MUSD to writers, creators, and the platform.
- **MEZO Holder Perks**:
    - **Detection**: `useMezoBalance` hook detects MEZO token holders on-chain.
    - **Badge**: "MEZO Holder" status surfaces in the payment flow for wallets with ≥ 1 MEZO.
    - **Future-Proof**: Roadmap includes on-chain boosted splits for MEZO holders via `MezoBoostedSplitter`.

### Creative Control
- **Image Regeneration**: "New Image" button per panel with loading state
- **Prompt Editing**: View/edit prompts, regenerate with custom text
- **Narrative Editing**: Hover-to-edit text in finale before minting
- **Outcome-based visual finish**: Fast exploration or Refined visuals; provider/model details stay out of the first-run path
- **Non-spoiler story shape**: Five-beat pre-generation structure preview without revealing the exact ending
- **Real-time Downloads**: Edited text exported in PNG comic download

### Comic Finale — Narration & Animation
The post-game finale (`domains/games/components/comic-book-finale.tsx`) is layered over
self-contained hooks + presentational components so each feature stays testable:

- **Voice Narration** (`finale-narration.tsx`): `useNarration` owns per-panel TTS
  caching, batch generation with progress %, per-panel regeneration, play/pause, and
  cinematic auto-play that advances panels. `NarrationControls` renders the toolbar
  (Narration button, Play/Pause, regenerate, Cinematic toggle). Panel 1 audio is
  pre-generated on mount; the next panel's image+audio are prefetched for snappy nav.
- **Video Animation Upsell** (`finale-video-motion.tsx` + `finale-video-screen.tsx`):
  `useVideoMotion(gameSlug)` owns status polling (only while `pending`), per-panel
  lookup, the start request, and style/error state. UI pieces are `VideoUpsellCTA`
  (Animate → Animated), `CinematicToggleButton`, `VideoStyleModal` (Radix `Dialog`),
  and `FinaleCinematicView` (`VideoShowcase` + `CreatorStats`). Completed animations
  surface in `FinaleCinematicView` and mark the game card with an "Animated" badge,
  plus attach a video URL to Twitter/Farcaster share copy.

### NFT Minting
- Mint games as NFTs on Base mainnet
- WriterCoinPayment contract handles payments + revenue splits
- On-chain metadata (creator, article URL, genre, difficulty)
- Compact success modal navigates to game page

### Farcaster Mini-App
- Full gameplay experience within Farcaster client
- Uses `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`
- Calls `sdk.actions.ready()` when UI loads
- Shares same API routes as web app

## Integrations

### Story Protocol (IP Registration)

**Network**: Story Aeneid testnet (Chain ID: 1315)  
**SDK**: `@story-protocol/core-sdk@^1.4.2`  
**Integration**: Client-side wallet signing (no platform keys)

**Features**:
- **User-owned IP**: Users sign transactions - they own the IP
- **PIL Licenses**: Commercial Remix licenses (10% royalty default)
- **Automatic metadata**: Game details, attribution, assets on IPFS
- **Derivative royalties**: Original creators earn from remixes
- **On-chain tracking**: Parent-child relationships recorded
- **Claimable revenue**: Royalty claiming UI for IP owners

**License Types**:
- **Non-Commercial Social Remixing** (ID: 1) - Free, derivatives allowed
- **Commercial Remix** (ID: 2) - Derivatives with revenue share (default)
- **Commercial Use** (ID: 3) - No derivatives allowed

**IP Registration Flow**:
1. User connects wallet, clicks "Register IP"
2. App validates wallet + network (switch to Story if needed)
3. Gas estimation with 15% buffer
4. User selects license type
5. Metadata uploaded to IPFS via Pinata, with Grove fallback
6. User signs transaction in wallet
7. IP registered on-chain with license
8. Verification: Read IP Asset to confirm

#### Inco Confidential Compute (Secret Panels) — *Primary*
**Integration**: Inco Lightning (`@inco/lightning-js`) for on-chain encrypted secret panels and Wordle answers.

- **On-Chain Encryption**: Secret panel JSON is split into ≤31-byte chunks, encrypted via `@inco/lightning-js`, and stored as multiple `euint256` handles in `SecretPanelVault.sol`.
- **Programmable Access Control**: `e.allow(handle, nftOwner)` — only the current NFT holder can decrypt. Enforced by Inco covalidators.
- **Attested Decrypt**: NFT holder decrypts via `zap.attestedDecrypt(walletClient, [handle])` — a signed covalidator attestation, not a trusted server.
- **Gameplay-Aware Unlock**: App verifies the player completed all 5 story panels before allowing decryption.
- **Provable Fairness**: Wordle answers encrypted on-chain via Inco instead of plaintext database fields.
- **Bundle Hygiene**: `@inco/lightning-js` is pure JS (no 5.5 MB WASM like CDR SDK).

**Secret Panel Flow**:
```
Game Generation
  ↓
generateSecretPanel() → store JSON in DB (pre-encryption)
  ↓
NFT minted → storeSecretPanel(tokenId, ciphertextChunks[]) on-chain
  ↓
promptVaultUuid = "inco:<tokenId>" in DB
  ↓
Player completes 5 panels + owns minted Game NFT
  ↓
Client calls attestedDecrypt via @inco/lightning-js → reveals epilogue
```

**Smart Contract**: [`SecretPanelVault`](https://basescan.org/address/0x36a3931f1acb69033f98e6eb8c3aa7d59cc6e5e8) on Base mainnet — `gameNFT` set to production [`GameNFT`](https://basescan.org/address/0x32D0356f533cC429F94Db73f383bBb21a459E16b)

**SDK**: `@inco/lightning-js` + `@inco/lightning` (Solidity, install via Bun)
**Docs**: https://docs.inco.org

### Hypercerts (Impact Certificates) — deprecated

> **Status: deprecated / not actively maintained.** The Hypercerts flow is preserved for reference but not currently supported.

**Protocol**: AT Protocol (AtpAgent)  
**PDS**: certified.app

**Features**:
- **Auto-created**: Impact certificate for each game created
- **Contributors**: Writer (50%), Creator (40%), Platform (10%)
- **Measurements**: Panel count, article fidelity score
- **Attachments**: Game metadata, article URL
- **Fallback**: Mock URIs when AT Protocol credentials not configured

**Flow**:
```
Game Creation → createGameHypercert() (async, non-blocking)
                      ↓
          AtpAgent.login() with handle + app password
                      ↓
          Create hypercert with contributors, measurements
                      ↓
          Save URI to Game.hypercertUri + Game.hypercertCid
```

### IPFS Storage (Pinata + Grove)

**Primary**: `PINATA_JWT` environment variable
**Fallback**: Grove immutable upload via `https://api.grove.storage`, using `GROVE_CHAIN_ID` (defaults to Base mainnet `8453`)
**Usage**: Metadata uploads for Story Protocol IP registration

For the optional hero-video artifact pipeline, Pinata is also required for binary media persistence. Grove currently covers metadata only; a provider-hosted video URL is not treated as durable. See [Video Artifact Pipeline](./VIDEO_ARTIFACT_PIPELINE.md).

- Production: Server-side upload route tries Pinata first, then Grove fallback if Pinata is missing or fails
- Development: Mock IPFS hash generation (for testing)
- Browser clients call `/api/ipfs/upload`; server secrets are never read from the client bundle
